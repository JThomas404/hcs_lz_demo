# Placeholder policy file.
#
# Planned checks for this file:
# - Define naming regex patterns for supported resource attributes.
# - Validate resource names (for example: name, bucket) against kebab-case.
# - Validate key aliases against alias/<kebab-case> conventions.
# - Emit deny messages for resources that do not meet naming standards.

# Placeholder policy file.

# Planned checks for this file:
# - Define the required governance tag set for all managed resources.
# - Detect missing tags and return deny messages with missing tag names.
# - Validate fixed-value tags such as project and db_type.
# - Ensure tag validation traverses root and nested module resources.

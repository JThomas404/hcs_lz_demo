# Placeholder Azure Pipeline definition.
#
# Planned content for this pipeline:
# - Trigger per stack or manual run with parameters.
# - Execute stack-specific validate/plan/apply flow.
# - Use shared templates to keep behavior consistent.
# - Inject environment-specific variables securely.
# - Capture and publish stack-level evidence artifacts.
